I'm just trying out a couple projects.

My goals as of now are:

* tic tac toe
* image recognition for handwritten numbers
* then i think it would be cool to find simple math functions, inject uncertainty (of different sorts, in x, in y absolutely, or in y relatively, ie like +/- .1*y, vs x+/- 5, vs x +/- .1x)
* i'm really interested in how much slower learning happens with diffeernt levels of uncertiainty, and using a simple math ufncition means infinite cheap "data" made anywhere i'm at/training it.
* Thanks for reading! :)
